# Hi, I'm Alexey Avramenko

**Senior Full Stack Web Developer (Backend-Focused)**  
7+ years of experience · Node.js, NestJS, React.js

Full Stack Web developer with 7+ years of commercial experience. Worked both independently and in teams, in various formats - from on-site to fully remote. Participated in projects from the earliest stages: from architecture and technology selection to releases and support. Also quickly integrated into existing products, diving into complex codebases. Have experience rewriting a monolithic application into a microservice architecture. In addition, shared experience within the team: mentored junior developers, reviewed test assignments, and helped new team members adapt.

My main focus is backend development (Node.js), but I also have solid experience in frontend (React.js) and mobile development (React Native). In one project, handled all three areas in parallel. In another, took over frontend support after budget cuts. Constantly follow the evolution of frameworks, libraries, and best practices, striving to apply them in daily work.
